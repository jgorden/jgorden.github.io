      <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereef's video</a> is interesting. He centers his talk around this idea of working in the kitchen versus sitting at the table waiting to be served. He says DBC is a kitchen where we are all trying to cook together, and sitting at the table is not the way to go.

       The skeptic in me would say that this is a brilliant way to cover the program from conflict. A way of saying, "this isn't a school so don't expect us to teach you!" Personally though, this does not worry me. If I was looking for school I would have gone for community college or looked to get another degree at a university. What I want is a guide and an introdcution to the industry. I feel like DBC was pretty upfront with how their program operates, so my expectations remain generally unchanged.

        Regarding excitement or nerves, sure, maybe a bit of both. Excitement comes naturally from learning something new, though nerves are a part of that package as well. I just try to stay confident in myself and keep learning.
