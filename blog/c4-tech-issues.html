		<p>Diversity in the technology industry seems to be a bit of a hot topic. There has been so much ink spilled on the topic I really do not have much to add, but will instead direct attention to interesting points I found, starting with <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/" class="darklink">this wonderful chart</a>! Apparently in 2014 many of the largest US tech companies sheepishly released their diversity demographics, and as we can see, they are quite heavily skewed. Particularly in favor of whites and males. </p>
		<p>On the race side of the issue, we actually have a fairly large portion of tech industry jobs held by Asians. While this in isolation is a positive sign, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/27/opinion/yang-tech-diversity/" class="darklink">this article</a> astutely points out there are still worrying signs. First, these numbers lump Asian-Americans and Permanent Residents together, the reality being only half of these jobs are held by Asian-Americans. Another disturbing problem that Yang highlights: "The percentage of whites, blacks and Hispanics who are executives is the same as their percentage in engineering roles. Asians, meanwhile, are about half as likely to be managers as they are to be coders and hardware hackers." The number of black and Hispanic workers within the tech industry is miserable to begin, and on top of this for Asians to be so severally under-represented amongst management positions is simply appalling. </p>
		<p>On the gender side I feel <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/10/hacking-techs-diversity-problem" class="darklink">this article</a> gives a very clear perspective of what women face in the tech industry. The number of biases that comes their way to this day is astounding really, to a point where it becomes hard to see how a woman could be successful at all. For example, this quote on simply what mothers face, "The researchers found that mothers were 79% less likely to be hired, half as likely to be promoted, offered an average of $11,000 less in salary, and held to higher performance and punctuality standards. Another study looked at mothers who were considered indisputably competent and committed. Because of their dedication to the job, they were seen as bad mothers and bad people." Keep in mind this is one subset of bias agaisnt women, there are many more. The numbers cited in this article are really quite damning. It is incredible such a progressive field can be so far behind when it comes to workplace equality. </p>
		<p>The good news here is that we have already taken the first step to addressing the problem of diversity, the largest leaders in the industry have all admitted to the problem and the need for change. The fact that there doesn't seem to be any argument, that the general consensus is that this is a massive problem, is a good thing. It will take time and effort, but I do not doubt that this issue will be addressed over time. </p>
