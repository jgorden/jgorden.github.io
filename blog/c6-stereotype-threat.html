		<p>Stereotype threat is the idea that negative stereotypes can negatively impact your performance. Perfectly reasonable idea. I would think we can all agree negative stereotypes are, well, negative. They are something we have battled as a society for a long time, and will continue to do so for perhaps an even longer time. </p>
		<p>I guess I am lucky, I cannot think of a time stereotype threat has affected me. I think this touches on my biggest problem with the theory, but it is, as is everything when it comes to humans, highly dependant on the individual. And not just the individual, but the context of the individual's surroundings. It is easy to see how stereotypes can kill a person's confidence, but nearly impossible to determine when it actually happens, as opposed to other outside sources. Doctor Steele admits as much in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1fzIuuXlkk" class="darklink">video</a> directed to us, that his results show something going on, but how much is due to stereotype threat is unclear. He estimates the effect in general is .6 of a standard deviation, a number that is not insignificant, but could also very easily be explained by random chance. What this number refers to even is unclear. Does this mean all identity groups in regards to academics? Is athletics included here? It seems almost silly to group all identities and all stereotypes together. Again, I don't necessarily disagree with they theory, I am just skeptical of the implementation I have seen. The idea that a negative stereotype can become a sort of self fulfilling prophecy and are outside of your own control is interesting, but I do not think it should dominate the conversation. I think what needs to be kept in focus here is that at the end of the day the individual is the determining factor for performance. If the individual is under performing maybe stereotype threat is a possible factor, maybe even a major factor if the individual has a strong connection to a persecuted identity! But it seems like most likely it is just a piece of the problem, and there are other contributing factors as well. </p>
		<p>Ways to avoid subjecting others to stereotype threat seems almost impossible really. There are countless ways people identify themselves, and you are boud to offend someone eventually. I guess I would say do your best to be accepting of all viewpoints and try not to be a dick. </p>
