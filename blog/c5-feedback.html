		<p>I like pairing. It has it's pros and cons, but end of the day I do enjoy it. I like the different perspective than mine. When working alone the biggest frustration is when I get stuck. I have just myself and the internet. When I am working with someone I can bounce ideas off them, they bounce ideas off me, it's a wonderful environment for productivity. If we were in the same room and could point at the screen I bet it would be even better. That said, I often times also enjoy working alone. Especially on long projects! I'll explain, even if it probably is a poor and unhealthy answer. But when I get in to something, I get IN to something. I like losing myself in a project. Like 'what is daylight, again?' lost in it. That's an exageration, what I mean is I like being selfish. When I work with someone I need to try and remember they are human and need breaks and food and tend to their own life. Perfectly acceptable! But when I work alone I can just think about myself, or really not think about myself and just think about the project. </p>
		<p>As far as feedback goes, writing it is a struggle for me. Considering I have zero experience with this stuff it feels wrong critiquing someone else, even if they are my peer. For all I know their methods work for them, and mine would be disaster for them. I try to provide advice I think would be helpful, but bottom line is I simply do not know. That said, I did enjoy reading my feedback. Seems people want me to be more forward with my thinking. I try to be accepting of all ideas, but I suppose this has led me to hold back on my own. Clarity is also something I think I can improve a lot on, and this is echoed in a few of the pieces of feedback.</p>
