    1. Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?<br>
    Had a conflict this afternoon. Went to the grocery store with my sister, we couldn't agree on anything to eat, besides the fact that neither of us wanted to cook. We ended up really hungry.<br><br>
    2. What was the source of the conflict?<br>
    The source was hunger. Also we ran out of coffee so I was feeling pretty sickly. Also it's super hot today guys, like unreasonably so. <br><br>
    3. What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?<br>
    Frustration I suppose. If hunger is an emotion, then that. But I guess mostly frustration.<br>
    4. What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?<br><br>
    I didn't, that was the problem. See what I should have done was buy a damn baumkuchen at Yaoyasan since it looked really tasty and I've never tried one before, but I held out because I didn't want to spend my money on a frivolous unhealthy dessert without eat real food. That was strike one. Strike two was not buying a sandwich afterwards, but they looked pretty awful. Just telling it like it is. I guess there was no third strike. Sorry for that letdown, my story telling isn't quite top tier.<br><br>
    5. If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?<br>
    I would have bought that damn baumkuchen! I'm serious, I'm going back next week. Like what the heck is a baumkuchen? A fancy donut? A strange cake? I don't even like sweets and I can't stop thinking about this thing. <br><br>
    6. What did you learn from this experience?<br>
    When presented with something new, be sure to eat it. Food always seems to resolve everything in my family, at least. In all seriousness I guess it would be to not be so rigid and just make flexible, informed decisions.
