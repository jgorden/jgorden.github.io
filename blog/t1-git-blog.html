     I used to play a lot of video games as a kid. Things like Mario and Zelda and Mega Man. Most of my memories involve tip toeing my way through a lengthy level only to be squashed by the boss, relegated back to square one. Soul crushing! I grew older, got a laptop to go to college, and I discovered video game emulators. Hours upon hours of procrastination ready nostalgia trips. I quickly learned the emulator had a “save state” feature. At any time, you could just hit “save state” and an instance of your game would be frozen in time. Tough boss coming up? Save state. Tough decision to be made? Save state. Completed any kind of small task? Save state! It felt like cheating (it was), you could go back to any saved time in your progression to replay or change the events you were not satisfied with over and over again. Version control is the “save state” function. It allows you, and others, to track progress incrementally through every step of the process.

       Git tracks changes in three separate steps. The first being when a change is made, Git will recognize this and list the modified files as unrecognized changes. You can then ‘add’ these changes, whereby Git will mark these files as ‘staged’. From here you can ‘commit’ the staged files, creating a sort of index of the change.

        The advantage of using Github for storing code is that it is online. This means you, or others, can access the code, theoretically, from anywhere at anytime. This is not only convenient for the individual user, but also makes collaboration a much easier task. Github also has the advantage of a large community, again furthering the ease of collaboration.
