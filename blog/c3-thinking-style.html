		<p>I am, at heart, a skeptic, and this goes double for psychology. Frankly, psychology as a field is proving more and more dubious as time progresses. All too often I will come across some new psychological study that is simply just bad science. If there is good and clear evidence I have no problems adopting new ideas and changing my views, but often I find myself questioning the methods, the integrity of the tests, and the viability of the statistics. Mind you, I do this for all studies I read! It just feels as though psychology papers often irritate me the most. They feed into the ego of the consumer. Who doesn't want to learn more about themselves? When I look at a study I try and always ask myself:
			<ul>
				<li>"What is the study trying to measure?"</li>
				<li>"What is the study actually measuring?"</li>
				<li>"What conclusions are possible?"</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Which brings us to this Gregorc Thinking Style assesment. This just wreaked of shoddy methodology. First the fact that it is a self conducted study. Again my questions, what is the study trying to measure and what is it actually measuring. I want to assess my 'thinking stlyle', but the questions are set in a way that it is measuring what <em>I think</em> is my thinking style. This result should show me more how I view myself than how I operate, but I don't even have evidence for that yet. </p>
		<p>In fact, the evidence behind Gregorc's 'Mind Styles Model' is very thin. <a href="http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED267247.pdf" class="darklink">This paper</a>(Sewall, 1986) gives a great breakdown of what the main flaws in Gregorc's model are. It begins with the lack of description for how his model was concieved. Much of Gregorc's work, it seems, has no basis except for his own prior works. This is fine when your aim is to sell books or create a religion like scientology, but lacking if the goal is academic rigor. Honestly, a quick google search turns up this quote from Reio and Wiswell(2006), "Consistent with Joniak and Isaksen (1988) and O'Brien (1990), the GSD did not display sufficient empirical evidence to validate the instrument's scores or to confirm Gregorc's theoretical interpretation of four learning style channels or two bipolar dimensions." Note that GSD refers to Gregorc Styles Delineator, the model in question. The tests and surveys are just woefully indescript, with numerous instances of possible bias. Gregorc then takes the flawed data from these tests and attempts to argue the validity of the study. Gregorc's results have not subsequently been reproduced, and it has been shown the reliability of the test is poor at best. </p>
		<p>I understand why we are assigned these types of thought exercises. Self-awareness is great. Understanding how you learn and and enabling yourself to do so is great. I feel lucky, I haven't struggled too much in my phase 0 experience so far. I'm going to keep doing what I have been doing, try to learn everyday and keep an open mind. But I will also keep my skepticism. Hopefully the next thought experiment is better researched and more convincing. </p>
