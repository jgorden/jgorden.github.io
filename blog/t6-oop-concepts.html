		<p>A block is a chunk of code. It's actually tough to explain in greater detail than that. Take a look at the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html#method-i-each" class="darklink">#each</a> method for arrays. The example syntax displays as follows:</p>
		<p>each { |item| block } â†’ ary</p>
		<p>Block! From my understanding, the block is in fact what goes between the curly braces {}. A chunk of code. You never really 'return' in a block, since that will return the method the block is a part of. A method, as it turns out, is really just 'yielding' blocks of code. That may sound sort of ambiguous, in essence a method is really just running a block of code in a specified way. Simple enough.</p>
		<p>A proc is a block. Or rather, a block is an object belonging to the clas Proc. So really what I mean is a block is a Proc. Proc stands for procedure. A Proc is really just a block with a name, it has been assigned.  A basic syntax would look something like so:</p>
		<p>name = Proc.new { |x| print x }</p>
		<p>That seems unnecessarily complicated, why use a Proc. The answer would be if you want to save your block for use later. Writing out a block repeatedly can be a waste, so saving it eases things like call backs or passing multiple blocks to a function. </p>
		<p>Finally, lambdas. A lambda is very similar to a Proc, the key difference being it is an anonymous function and you can call 'return' in it. Other than that it really is just behaves like a method with no name. You can create it using 'lambda {}' and but your code in the curly braces. </p>
