		<p>It seems as though looping in Javascript and Ruby are not all that different. Maybe that is the point. Ruby seems more intuitive, while Javascript seems more explicit.</p>
		<p>So what do I mean by that! Let me attempt to explain. If you want to loop through something in Ruby you find a method or enumerable. It's easy, you look for the word that makes sense and you apply it. Want to modify each element of an array? How about '.each'. Want to map a set of values to a new array while adding a transformation? Use '.map'. In this way Ruby is super intuitive. It codes like spoken English. The only real downside is not knowing exactly how all these nifty methods operate. If you will allow for a completely unproffesional analogy, it works like the underpants gnomes meme:</p>
		<p>1. Call method<br>
			2. Feed method<br>
			3. ?????<br>
			4. Proft</p>
			<p>Sure, I can guess what step 3 is sometimes, but the point is the meat and potatoes behind the code is hidden. Javascript isn't like that. What it lacks in fancy methods it makes up for in clarity. My best and worst friend is probably the for loop. You can do everything with the for loop! So much so that I probably get really uncreative, because my first thought is usually, "this could be solved pretty easily with a for loop." Here is your basic for loop: </p>
			<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for (var i = 0; condition for i; increment for i){code block}
			</p>
			<p>Here we start with our counting variable 'i', determine the range of 'i', and the increment at which 'i' will change. Then we give it a code block. The Ruby array.each method in Javascript would look something like this:</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for (var i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++){<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(array[i]);<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
			</p>
			<p>The above would simply log the values of an array to the console. The .map method would look the same, the difference being in the code block we would push each value of the array(plus any transformation) into a new array. This syntax does not look very much like English. Not in the slightest. But it does show very clearly what the computer is doing, which can also be refreshing. </p>
