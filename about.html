		<p>My name is Joji Gorden, and I hail from Berkeley, California. I have an endless fascination with languages, and a BA in linguistics from the University of California, Los Angeles to show for it. It is indeed why I became interested in programming in the first place. For me, the appeal of language is the endless possibility that it presents. The end goal is always communication, be it with another person, computer, what have you. There is never one answer, only many different paths to a common goal. What path to take and what shape it takes is up to the creator, and oh boy do I love being a creator. </p>
